notes for Project 2 
07012021
This will be the first of several notes I will write for the Rice Univ. Fintech bootcamp Project 2. 
I have been practicing for the past few days on setting up the Twitter API, obtaining data from the API, and using git branching.
This is my second attempt at git branching a repo. 
Hopefully, during class, we will flesh out our project idea and begin collecting more data.
